ðŸ§¾ Data Preprocessing Pipeline
This project focuses on building a robust data preprocessing pipeline to prepare datasets for machine learning. It covers handling missing values, outlier treatment, feature scaling, and categorical data imputation. This pipeline ensures your data is clean, consistent, and ready for modeling or analysis.

ðŸš€ Features
Clean and preprocess raw data

Handle missing values in both numeric and categorical features

Detect and treat outliers using the IQR method

Normalize numerical features using StandardScaler

Prepare consistent, clean datasets for downstream machine learning tasks

ðŸ“Š Project Workflow
ðŸ”¹ Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values:

Numeric: Filled with mean

Categorical: Filled with mode

Detect and treat outliers:

Use Interquartile Range (IQR)

Replace outliers with mean values

Normalize numeric features:

Standardization using Scikit-learnâ€™s StandardScaler

ðŸ”¹ (Optional Extension)
Although this repo focuses on preprocessing, it's designed to fit seamlessly into broader machine learning workflows including:

Feature selection

EDA integration

Model building and evaluation

ðŸ§° Technologies Used
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn
